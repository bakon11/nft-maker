Maker of logical NFTz

More instructions coming very soon. 

This is a VERY early stage of this NFT maker. It will allow you to create filter functions and somewhat configurable layers.
It uses the Sharp Image procesing library(https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-constructor)
<hr />

**What are filter functions?**<br />
If you have layers that don't match with each other in a single collection.<br />
Insted of running a NFT generator over and over with different file structures etc etc.<br />
Now you can build a function, that will check if specified layer/attribute has ben selected and what it can or can't be used with.<br />
<hr />

***Woking On***<br />
